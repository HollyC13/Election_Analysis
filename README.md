##  Challenge Summary
The script used to determine this election result and provide audit items for your review can be used similarly for other elections.  With minor modifications,
the results of this audit could be reproduced in local and state elections of all kinds.  Audit data in other areas could be provided as well.  Here are a few that come
to mind:
-   determine the percentage of registered voters in each county who cast votes;
-   determine the percentage of men/women voters who voted for each candidate;
-   a determination of votes cast by voter age;
-   a determination of votes cast by voters who are a registered member of one of the main political parties.
